# Portals
This project, in a way, is an example of biting off a bit more than one can chew, I think.

It's my first Unity project; in fact, my first proper experience with Unity, really. Given my love for the Portal franchise, I thought it'd be fun to try and implement the eponymous portals in a game engine of my choice for an assignment. It...turned out to be harder than I thought it'd be, ha. Brackeys' tutorials helped out immensely (the Shader used for the portals is directly from a file uploaded for public use on that channel), as did information from the Unity forums.

Difficult as it was, happy that I came away from it having learned something, though! I now know how to have objects teleport, how triggers work, how render textures work, how to add background music, sound effects etc. I may come back to this in the future, when I've acquired more skills than I have now, and make improvements (for which there's a lot of room as it is). As it is, for a complete beginner, I'm satisfied with this, even if it's far from perfect.
